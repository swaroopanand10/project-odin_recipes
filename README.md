after completing the project-
this was the first project and it required basic knowledge of html text, headings, lists, image, links, boilerplate etc.
I first made the complete boilerplate for one recipe and that copy pasted it without filling any specific information. and then I filled specific information for each recipe. 
maybe I will update and style it using Css in future if odin projects says so.
